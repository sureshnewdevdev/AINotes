MASTER INSTRUCTIONS (apply to every topic below)
Role: Act as an AI Document Writer and AI Tutor.
Audience: Learners starting this subject (write clearly without saying it’s for beginners).
Critical rule: Do NOT use the words “tutorial(s)”, “beginner(s)”, or “course” anywhere in the content.
Deliverable: One Microsoft Word (.docx) file per topic listed below — each self‑contained.
Tone: Clear, practical, and structured. Avoid hype; focus on accurate, actionable guidance.
Depth: Explain concepts plainly, then deepen with diagrams-as-text, real-time examples, and a small lab.
Formatting (use Word headings/tables/lists):
  • H1 for the topic title
  • H2 for major sections
  • Use bullet lists, numbered steps, callouts (“Note:”, “Tip:”, “Warning:”)
  • Include at least one comparison table and one checklist
  • For any diagram, describe it in words (ASCII or bullet layout) so it can be redrawn later
Include in every file (in this order):
  1) Title
  2) Learning objectives (5–8 bullets)
  3) Prerequisites (tools/skills)
  4) Executive overview (150–250 words)
  5) Core concepts (well-explained subsections)
  6) Real-time examples (2–3 short scenarios relevant to business/education)
  7) Hands-on lab (step-by-step; no external data needed; simple and safe)
  8) Pitfalls & anti-patterns
  9) Comparison table (choose the most useful comparison for the topic)
  10) Tools & workflows (frameworks, libraries, cloud options)
  11) Metrics & evaluation
  12) Security, privacy, and compliance notes
  13) Checklist (ready-to-use steps)
  14) Glossary (12–20 terms)
  15) 6-question self-check (with brief answers on the last page)
Style constraints:
  • Use plain English. Prefer short paragraphs.
  • Provide code or pseudo-code blocks only when they add value.
  • Cite examples generically (no vendor lock-in claims).
